# CheckIn API

This API was developed as a part of my graduating paper. All the related documentation can be found in Markdown format here: [checkin-docs](https://github.com/toledompm/checkin-docs)

## Up and running:

A Makefile has been included to help setup this application. If you want to see the available commands, just run `make`.

First create and fill out the `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
make setup
```

Finaly, just run the application!

```bash
make start
```
